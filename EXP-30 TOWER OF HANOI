% move(N,X,Y,Z) - move N disks from peg X to peg Y, with peg Z being the
%                 auxilliary peg
%
% Strategy:
% Base Case: One disc - To transfer a stack consisting of 1 disc from
%    peg X to peg Y, simply move that disc from X to Y
% Recursive Case: To transfer n discs from X to Y, do the following:
% Transfer the first n-1 discs to some other peg X
%        Move the last disc on X to Y
%         Transfer the n-1 discs from X to peg Y

     move(1,X,Y,_) :-
         write('Move top disk from '),
         write(X),
         write(' to '),
         write(Y),
nl.
     move(N,X,Y,Z) :-
         N>1,
         M is N-1,
         move(M,X,Z,Y),
         move(1,X,Y,_),
         move(M,Z,Y,X).
